The research model, applied to 184 countries between 1990 and 2018, estimated that compared to 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018 due to poor diet. Over 14 million new cases in 2018 were primarily attributed to eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats. The study emphasizes that unhealthy food choices, particularly the consumption of refined carbs and processed meats, contribute more to the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes than a lack of wholesome foods.
