    " - Improving from a 7b model.  Probably the biggest barrier is that a 7b model's outputs can only be so good.  It often doesn't follow instuctions or just avoids outputting sometimes.  Perhaps this behavior would change with a better model, though I'm skeptical that I'd be able to run any larger model on my M1 8GB.\n",
    " - Fine tuning on custom dataset.  Might be possible on slightly better computer using some kind of PEFT technique.  I'd have to use gpt to get me some traning data, though.\n",
    " - Improve news collection pipeline.  It's important to get a variety of sources, and maybe the best way to do that is not just through arbirary RSS feeds.\n",
    " - LLM memory.  The ability to ask follow up questions would be nice, but I doubt this model's ability to handle very specific questions.\n",
